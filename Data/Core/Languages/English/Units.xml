	<entry name="Necrons/HeavyDestroyerLord" value="Heavy Destroyer Lord"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/HeavyDestroyerLordDescription" value="Heroic unit that adapts and decimates its targets from a distance."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/HeavyDestroyerLordFlavor" value="Although less common than Destroyer Lords, Heavy Destroyer Lords abandon melee in favor of a very powerful arsenal. Designed on the same principle as Heavy Destroyers, this Lord is intended to eradicate its targets with great lethality. Whether it's an armored element or an army of infantrymen, nothing can stand in their way. Furthermore, the Heavy Destroyer Lord can rely on his subordinates who carry out his orders to the letter, eradicating his enemies with inhuman precision. The little nobility that remains in this envelope of destruction is dedicated to serving only one purpose: the total annihilation of his enemies."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/BloodCanoptek" value="Infected Canoptek Spyder"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/BloodCanoptekDescription" value="Heroic utility vehicle that drains health and energy."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/BloodCanoptekFlavor" value="This infected Canoptek Spyder has been infected by the Flayer virus, a curse uttered by C'tan Llandu'gor before he was annihilated by the Necrons, and she behaves like a Flayed One while applying her ancient precepts. Although bloodthirsty, she can still carry out her old missions and maintain the Necron armies. But her behavior has evolved, and she's become vicious, with an obvious appetite for flesh. She slaughters her targets with frenzied fury and zeal, hacking metal and flesh to pieces as if nothing had happened. She vampires vehicles and spreads corrupted codes to wreak havoc on opposing ranks. She can also unleash swarms of equally corrupted Scarab Canopteks, infecting other damaged Necrons and turning them into Flayed Ones. She is an engine of death that will haunt the battlefield, before and after."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/BloodScarab" value="Infected Canoptek Scarabs"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/BloodScarabDescription" value="A frenzied swarm that crushes the enemy with sheer force of numbers, they can also sacrifice themselves to heal theirs allies or enrage the Flayed Ones."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/BloodScarabFlavor" value="These Scarabs, like the infected Canoptek Spyder, are infected and their behavior is altered. Although less enduring than their counterparts, they are bloodthirsty and will be able to inflict more damage on the enemy while regenerating every time they inflict wounds. Although consumed by this bloodthirsty madness, they can still be used to repair damaged Necron units. But they can also parasitize Flayed Ones to boost their combat efficiency. In both cases, Scarabs cease to exist."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/DoomsdayMonolith+" value="Doomsday Monolith"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/DoomsdayMonolith+Description" value="Super heavy device who dominate the battlefield and much more powerful with Monoliths by his side."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/DoomsdayMonolith+Flavor" value="A Doomsday Monolith is found at the centre of a Doomsday Phalanx, and is a heavily modified Necron Monolith protected by an unknown design of energy field. It is capable of focusing awesome destructive energies, and is more powerful than a regular Monolith.It otherwise functions in the same way as a regular Monolith, and is capable of using its portal to deploy Necron Warriors from reserve or from other parts of the battlefield. A Doomsday Phalanx consists of at least three regular Necron Monoliths, with the Doomsday Monolith at its core. The first sighting of a Phalanx was during the Damnos Incident."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/VoidDragon" value="Shard of Mag'ladroth, the Void Dragon"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/VoidDragonDescription" value="Hero who dominates matter to annihilate his enemies."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/VoidDragonFlavor" value="The Void Dragon, sometimes called The Dragon, although its proper name was Mag'ladroth, was one of the few C'tans worshiped by the Necrons. Master of technology and endowed with an understanding of matter that defies the most sophisticated sciences, the Void Dragon Shard has terrible powers that can change the course of a war. Some Tech-Priests believe that the Void Dragon, or a large fragment of C'tan, is the true God-Machine worshiped by the Machine Cult of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Although reduced to a shard like his peers, he nonetheless remains extremely powerful. Hijacking enemy machines for this own purposes or spewing terrible lightning bolts, no one can hope to escape easily. The Void Dragon is remembered as the most technologically advanced and capable C'tan, and that is almost still the case. Beware."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Trazyn" value="Trazyn, the Infinite"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/TrazynDescription" value="Tenacious hero who harvests and collects artifacts as well as his enemies."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/TrazynFlavor" value="Trazyn the Infinite is an ancient Necron Overlord of the Nihilakh Dynasty noted amongst his kind as a keeper of history and a preserver of artifacts and events on the Tomb World of Solemnace. The vast and numberless vaults burrowed through the Tomb World of Solemnace are crowded with technologies so rare and sublime that any Adeptus Mechanicus Tech-priest would give the life of several close colleagues just to know that they existed. He is known to hold technologies and relics that are so rare as to be priceless. Trazyn's nature means that he is loathe to explore the galaxy himself but his desire to gather exquisite artifacts to both see and cataologue forces him to go out amongst the stars, when there is an opportunity he cannot afford to miss. Trazyn's philosophy of preserving the past is in stark contrast to the Cryptek Orikan the Diviner's hope of changing it for a better future and the two were hated enemies even in life. Trazyn has traveled almost the entire galaxy in search of new pieces to complete his already unique collection. He surveys the stars aboard his cruiser and adopts behavior that varies according to his needs and objectives. He therefore happens to make common cause with other factions and races. But despite this, many fear Trazyn and would like to see him permanently destroyed, this thought is shared by many Necrons."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Orikan" value="Orikan, the Diviner"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/OrikanDescription" value="Powerful cryptek that master the space-time."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/OrikanFlavor" value="Orikan, also known as Orikan the Diviner, is one of the most powerful of the Necron Crypteks, and is a potent chronomancer. Millions of Terran years ago, he was the astromancer of the Necrontyr empire's ruling Triarch, and one of the Silent King Szarekh's most trusted counsellors. Orikan was the only one to then oppose the proposal of the C'tan Mephet'ran the Deceiver to grant the Necrontyr immortality through the process of biotransference, as he foresaw it would end in disaster, but his lone voice of dissent was ignored by the Triarch. Driven by loyalty to his race, Orikan submitted to the process and became one of the undying Necrons, forever undying and soulless in an android body of living metal. He is opposed to Trazyn the Infinite as much about morality as philosophy but they'll tend to allied each other when the time come dire."/>
