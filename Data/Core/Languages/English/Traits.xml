	<entry name="Necrons/DestroyerDescription" value="Increases the accuracy of adjacent Destroyers."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/DestroyerFlavor" value="The Heavy Destroyer Lord guides his peers with inhuman lethality. These followers of organized destruction become more effective when they receive their orders directly from their Lord."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Hainevivant" value="Protocols for destruction of living"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/HainevivantDescription" value="The Heavy Destroyer Lord is more effective against biological targets, but less against mechanical or inert targets."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/HainevivantFlavor" value="Already formidable, the Heavy Destroyer Lord decided to focus on biological targets to significantly increase its effectiveness. It therefore becomes much more dangerous against all targets that are not vehicles, fortifications, Necrons or cyborgs. This protocol is incompatible with the destruction of the inert."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Haineinerte" value="Protocols for destruction of the inert"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/HaineinerteDescription" value="The Heavy Destroyer Lord is more effective against mechanical targets, but less against biological targets."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/Siphon" value="Energy Drain"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/SiphonDescription" value="The infected Canoptek Spyder stuns an enemy vehicle to drain energy."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/SiphonFlavor" value="Although rare, it is possible that Canoptek Spyder can drain electrical power from vehicles or buildings. In general it is often to stop a debacle by finding the energy necessary to relieve the destroyed Necron troops. But the infected Mecarachnid does not hesitate to plant its numerous claws in the metal of its victim to drain the energy, leaving the vehicle empty and vulnerable."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Corruption" value="Machine corruption"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/CorruptionDescription" value="The infected Canoptek Spyder spreads corrupted code that reduces the accuracy of enemy vehicles and increases their morale loss."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/CorruptionFlavor" value="The Necrons have technology beyond comprehension and many species have tried to unlock their secrets, but in vain. The slightest synthetic or mechanical entity fears the technologies that the Necrons can deploy on the battlefield. Because when corrupted Necron code is released, vehicles and cyborgs quickly suffer damages or hallucinations. Leaving crews and troops to contend with machines that are going completely crazy."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Soif" value="Blood Lust"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/SoifDescription" value="The infected Canoptek Spyder heals itself when she deals damage."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/SoifFlavor" value="The final transformation that would allow a Flayed Ones to quench his thirst never occurs, lending credence to the legend that the curse was the final gift of one of the C'tan: Llandu'gor, the Flayer. For this Canoptek Spider corrupted by the virus, it is indeed this same hunger which guides its senses."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Enragement" value="Fury of the Flayed Ones"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/EnragementDescription" value="Infected Scarab Canopteks can sacrifice themselves to increase attack, movement, damages and grant life theft to the targeted Flayed Ones squad."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/EnragementFlavor" value="Scarabs corrupted by the virus can easily arouse the senses of Flayed Ones. By uniting with them like parasites, they gain in speed, aggressiveness and lethality."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Monolithium" value="Energy Grid"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/MonolithiumDescription" value="The Doomsday Monolith drains energy from a Monolith, which deactivates, to increase the power of its weaponry."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/MonolithiumFlavor" value="Instead of firing a particle whip, or teleporting a unit, nearby Monoliths can grant the energy from their Power Matrix to the Doomsday Monolith, which is capable of focusing this power to increase the intensity of its Gauss Obliterator."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/PSG" value="Phase Shift Generator"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/PSGDescription" value="The Doomsday Monolith reduces damage taken by nearby units."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/PSGFlavor" value="A Phase Shift Generator is a device found on Necron Pylons. It is presumably similar to the Wraith's phase shift ability but on a much greater scale. The field projected by the Pylon surrounds it for a great distance and allows Necrons within the field to survive attacks which would normally destroy them outright."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Phase" value="Phase Teleport"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/PhaseDescription" value="The Doomsday Monolith teleports and becomes resistant to ranged attacks."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/PhaseFlavor" value="Necron knowledge and technologies related to the art of controlling time and matter remain unmatched to this day. What seems impossible for other species remains simple for the Necrons, who can teleport their Monoliths over great distances and despite their imposing mass. Worse, as the Monolith resurfaces at the desired position it is almost impossible to deal any damage to it as it finishes its phase. Like a spectral pyramid, it is visible to all but also intangible."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/EnergyField" value="Unknown energy field"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/EnergyFieldDescription" value="The Doomsday Monolith suffers less damages."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/EnergyFieldFlavor" value="No one knows how this energy field works, however its effectiveness is undoubted. Even the most violent impacts and explosions fail to pierce the imposing mass of the Doomsday Monolith."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/PartSpiri" value="Cloud of Spiritual Particles"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/PartSpiriDescription" value="The Void Dragon's C'tan Shard becomes harder to hit."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/PartSpiriFlavor" value="Covered in this cloud, the projectiles will pass through the Void Dragon's C'tan Shard as if nothing had happened. This vaporous form will not last but will allow the splinter to get out of a bad situation to recover before "/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Moléculaire" value="Molecular Destabilization"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/MoléculaireDescription" value="The Void Dragon's C'tan Shard reduces the armor of nearby enemies."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/MoléculaireFlavor" value="The Void Dragon Shard filled the air around it with a distorted, stinging sound. With a single gesture, he can undo the war machines of the lower races, then attract disintegrated matter to herself like black holes in order to reconstitute their constantly fluctuating envelope. Complete control of matter allows him to disassemble the strongest materials with a single thought."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/VoltaicStorm" value="Voltaic Storm"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/VoltaicStormDescription" value="The Void Dragon's C'tan Shard gains additional attacks for his transdimensional thunderbolts."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/VoltaicStormFlavor" value="When this C'tan points one imperious hand, foes reel as the air sings with a monstrous whine. The awful sound builds, then erupts into a sudden and ferocious storm of emerald lightning to annihilate all it touches."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/EmpathicObliteratorFlavor" value="Should the Empathic Obliterator slay an enemy, a psionic shockwave ripples out from the body of the victim, striking down all nearby creatures of similar mind and purpose."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Musée" value="My collection is incomplete"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/MuséeDescription" value="Trazyn can capture targets more often and generates more influence."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/MuséeFlavor" value="I realize you've been wandering my galleries, and the fact that you were able to identify in such a short time that three regiments of Catachan soldiers were still missing from my Acabrius War collection speaks to your eye for this genre. thing. But from there to send me five complete regiments ! Such generosity will allow me to eliminate and replace a few less valuable pieces in my collection. — Hyperparchment from Trazyn the Infinite to Inquisitor Valéria"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Musée1" value="Unit Capture"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Musée1Description" value="Trazyn captures and ships his weakened new catch off-planet, generating a bit of influence."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Musée1Flavor" value="The Prismatic Galleries. These are some of the most prized possessions of Trazyn and consist of holographic events recapturing events from history deemed worthy of preservation. These galleries are not populated by mere sculpture, but by conscious living beings transmuted into the holograph themselves."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/Collector" value="Quantum storage"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/CollectorFlavor" value="Trazyn can store a large quantity of objects and artifacts that he may have found on the planet. Although he prefers collecting more than war, he will not hesitate to use them if the situation calls for it."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/Infini" value="Lord of the Infinite"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/InfiniFlavor" value="After millennia of traveling the galaxy, Trazyn is impervious to loss of morale and therefore cannot be shaken. If he fails, he will come back and start again some time later. He is patient, smart and meticulous."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/PhaseShifter" value="Phase Shifter"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/PhaseShifterDescription" value="Orikan gains ranged damage reduction."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/PhaseShifterFlavor" value="A Phase Shifter is a form of Necron phase technology that truly demonstrates that species' technological superiority over all others in the galaxy. Using a form of unknown inter-dimensional science, a Phase Shifter renders its bearer's form hazy and indistinct, as though he was not completely corporeal. Shots and blows can then pass through the user's mechanical necrodermis body, meaning that even the most powerful weapons cannot harm him."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/TemporalSnare" value="Temporal Snare"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/TemporalSnareDescription" value="Orikan slow down a target that deal less attacks, suffer more damages and move one tile only."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/TemporalSnareFlavor" value="A Temporal Snare is a Necron device that warps the fabric of space-time itself, creating a bubble of altered space-time where time flows more slowly for anyone or anything trapped within it. They are only carried by the Cryptek Orikan. Each Temporal Snare is a technologically-advanced temporal trap that can severely impede enemy movement once it is activated, whether those trapped within its field are vehicles or infantry. Thus, even when traversing the smoothest of terrains, once a snare is activated, enemy units can still find themselves moving at a snail's pace from the subjective perception of those observers outside the device's range of effect."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/StarsAreRightDescription" value="Orikan becomes more powerful and gains attacks, damages, movement and accuracy for a limited time."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/StarsAreRightFlavor" value="Wherever he goes, whenever he fights, there is always a chance that the stars will come into alignment and restore to Orikan a portion of ancient power. Whenever this happens, the body of Orikan coruscates with pent-up energy, and his prowess on the battlefield increases tenfold. However, such correct celestial alignments are often fleeting, and Orikan eventually powers down, sometimes mere minutes after he first received his initial empowerment."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/StarsAreRight" value="Stars Are Not Right"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/StarsAreRightDescription" value="Orikan becomes weak and deals less attacks, damage, accuracy and movement for a limited time."/>

	<entry name="Necrons/FuturDescription" value="Orikan does not trigger enemy overwatch."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/FuturFlavor" value="Orikan is a consummate chronomancer, able to calculate the events of the future from the patterns of the stars. Thus did he know of the Fall of the Aeldari, the Rise of Man, the Horus Heresy and the coming of the Tyranids many thousands of Terran years before they came to pass. Through careful study and scrutiny, Orikan can even divine lesser occurrences such as movement of fleets, the destinies of individuals, even the strategies undertaken by campaigning armies and events not important enough to reshape the galaxy, but the foreknowledge of which can dramatically change the fortunes of the beholder."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/StaffofTomorrow" value="Staff of the Tomorrow"/>
	<entry name="Necrons/StaffofTomorrowDescription" value="Orikan stuns his enemy when he acts on overwatch."/>
	<entry name="Necrons/StaffofTomorrowFlavor" value="This unique example of advanced Necron time manipulation technology exists a fraction of a second ahead of any given moment in the normal space-time continuum. This property allows Orikan to strike at his target an instant before the foe even moves to do so. The Staff of Tomorrow can also penetrate all known forms of infantry armour, in a similar way to a Power Weapon, further enhancing its devastating effect in melee."/>
